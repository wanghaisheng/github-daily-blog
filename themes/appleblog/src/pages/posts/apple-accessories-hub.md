const ImageCarousel = () => {
  const settings = {
    dots: true,
    infinite: true,
    speed: 500,
    slidesToShow: 1,
    slidesToScroll: 1,
  };

  return (
    <Slider {...settings}>
      <div>
        <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Product 1" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Product 2" />
      </div>
      {/* Additional slides */}
    </Slider>
  );
};
```

### Shopping Cart Functionality

The shopping cart is managed using Redux, allowing for a centralized state that can be accessed and modified from any component. Here’s an example of how to add an item to the cart:

```javascript
// actions/cartActions.js
export const addToCart = (product) => ({

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const elements = useElements();

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const cardElement = elements.getElement(CardElement);
    const { error, paymentMethod } = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
      type: 'card',
      card: cardElement,
    });

    if (error) {
      console.error(error);
    } else {
      console.log('Payment Method:', paymentMethod);
      // Handle successful payment
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <CardElement />
      <button type="submit" disabled={!stripe}>Pay</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

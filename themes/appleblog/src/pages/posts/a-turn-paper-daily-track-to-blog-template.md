## 2. Key Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the tracking and extraction modules.
- **Beautiful Soup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, used for extracting content from web pages.
- **MkDocs**: A static site generator that is geared towards project documentation, which we leverage for creating the blog structure.
- **Astro**: A modern static site generator that allows for building fast websites with a focus on performance and flexibility.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD, automating the deployment of the blog whenever new content is generated.

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### Paper Tracking Module

The paper tracking module uses a combination of web scraping and API calls to gather the latest papers. For example, using the arXiv API:

```python
import requests

def fetch_latest_papers(keywords):
    url = f"http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:{keywords}&start=0&max_results=5"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.text
```

### Content Extraction Module

The content extraction module utilizes Beautiful Soup to parse the fetched paper content. Here’s how we extract the abstract:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def extract_abstract(paper_html):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(paper_html, 'html.parser')
    abstract = soup.find('blockquote', class_='abstract').get_text()
    return abstract
```

### Blog Generation Module

The blog generation module formats the extracted content into Markdown, which MkDocs can process:

```python
def generate_blog_post(title, abstract, content):
    blog_post = f"# {title}\n\n## Abstract\n{abstract}\n\n## Content\n{content}\n"
    return blog_post
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: Handling Different Paper Formats

Research papers can come in various formats (PDF, HTML, etc.). We implemented a format detection mechanism to handle this:

```python
def detect_format(file_path):
    if file_path.endswith('.pdf'):
        return 'pdf'
    elif file_path.endswith('.html'):
        return 'html'
    else:
        return 'unknown'
```

### Challenge 2: Ensuring Content Quality

Not all abstracts and content are well-structured. We implemented a validation step to ensure the extracted content meets certain quality criteria:

```python
def validate_content(abstract, content):
    if len(abstract) < 50 or len(content) < 100:
        raise ValueError("Content is too short")
```

### Challenge 3: Automating Deployment

Using GitHub Actions, we set up a workflow to automatically deploy the blog whenever new content is generated. Here’s a simplified version of the workflow file:

```yaml
name: Deploy Blog

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build with MkDocs
        run: mkdocs build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./site
```

## Conclusion

This automated blog generation system effectively tracks the latest research papers, extracts relevant content, and formats it into a user-friendly blog. By leveraging modern technologies like MkDocs and Astro, we ensure that the blog is not only functional but also visually appealing

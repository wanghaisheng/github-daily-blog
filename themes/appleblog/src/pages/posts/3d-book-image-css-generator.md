- **Frameworks/Libraries**: While the README does not specify, a lightweight library like jQuery or a modern framework like React could be used to enhance interactivity and manage state.

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### CSS 3D Transformations
The core functionality of the generator relies on CSS 3D transformations. Here’s an example of how a 3D book cover might be implemented using CSS:

```css
.book {
  width: 150px;
  height: 200px;
  position: relative;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  transform: perspective(1000px);
}

.book .cover {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}

.book .front {
  background: url('cover.jpg') no-repeat center center;
  background-size: cover;
}

.book .back {
  background: #f0f0f0; /* Placeholder for back cover */
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
```

### Dynamic Parameter Customization
The application allows users to customize parameters such as perspective and thickness. This is achieved through JavaScript, which updates the CSS properties in real-time based on user input:

```javascript
function updatePerspective(value) {
  const bookElement = document.querySelector('.book');
  bookElement.style.transform = `perspective(${value}px)`;
}
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
One of the significant challenges in implementing 3D transformations is ensuring compatibility across different browsers. The team had to test and adjust CSS properties to ensure consistent rendering in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

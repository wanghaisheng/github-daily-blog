## Under the Hood

# Technical Deep-Dive: D-shirts E-commerce Platform

## 1. Architecture Decisions

The D-shirts platform is designed as a full-stack e-commerce application, leveraging a modern architecture that separates concerns between the frontend and backend. The architecture follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, with Laravel serving as the backend framework and Vue.js as the frontend framework. 

### Key Architectural Choices:
- **Inertia.js**: This library acts as a bridge between Laravel and Vue, allowing for a single-page application (SPA) experience without the complexity of a traditional API. It enables server-side rendering while maintaining a dynamic client-side experience.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The application is structured to keep the backend logic (Laravel) separate from the frontend presentation (Vue). This separation allows for easier maintenance and scalability.
- **Microservices for Payment and Email**: By using Stripe for payments and Resend for email services, the application offloads critical functionalities to specialized services, enhancing security and reliability.

## 2. Key Technologies Used

The D-shirts platform utilizes a robust tech stack that includes:

- **Backend**: 
  - **Laravel**: A PHP framework that provides a clean and elegant syntax, making it easier to build web applications.
  
- **Frontend**: 
  - **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, known for its reactivity and component-based architecture.
  - **Inertia.js**: Facilitates SPA-like navigation while using server-side routing.
  
- **Styling**: 
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with a focus on customization.
  
- **Components**: 
  - **PrimeVue**: A collection of rich UI components for Vue.js, enhancing the user interface with pre-built components.
  
- **Payments**: 
  - **Stripe**: A payment processing platform that provides a secure way to handle transactions.
  
- **Email**: 
  - **Resend**: A service for sending transactional emails, ensuring reliable communication with users.

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### User-Friendly Cart System
One of the standout features of the D-shirts platform is its user-friendly cart system, which allows users to add items to their cart without requiring account creation. This is achieved through Laravel sessions, which store cart data temporarily.

```php
// Example of adding an item to the cart
public function addToCart(Request $request, $productId)
{
    $cart = session()->get('cart', []);
    
    if(isset($cart[$productId])) {
        $cart[$productId]['quantity']++;
    } else {
        $cart[$productId] = [
            "name" => $request->name,
            "quantity" => 1,
            "price" => $request->price,
            "image" => $request->image
        ];
    }
    
    session()->put('cart', $cart);
    return redirect()->back()->with('success', 'Product added to cart!');
}
```

### Stripe Integration
The integration with Stripe for payment processing is a critical aspect of the platform. The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a payment intent:

```php
// Example of creating a payment intent with Stripe
public function createPayment(Request $request)
{
    \Stripe\Stripe::setApiKey(env('STRIPE_SECRET'));

    $paymentIntent = \Stripe\PaymentIntent::create([
        'amount' => $request->amount,
        'currency' => 'usd',
        'payment_method_types' => ['card'],
    ]);

    return response()->json(['clientSecret' => $paymentIntent->client_secret]);
}
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Learning Curve with Inertia.js
One of the significant challenges faced during development was the initial learning curve associated with Inertia.js. Understanding how to effectively manage state and routing between Laravel and Vue required a shift in thinking, especially for developers accustomed to traditional REST APIs.

### Handling Background Tasks
Implementing Laravel queue jobs for background task handling was another challenge. This feature allows the application to process tasks such as sending emails or processing payments without blocking the main application flow. The following code snippet illustrates how to dispatch a job:

```php
// Example of dispatching a job to send an email
SendEmailJob::dispatch($user);
```

### Security Considerations
Ensuring the security of user data, especially during payment processing, was paramount. The application employs best practices such as using HTTPS, validating user inputs, and securely storing API keys in environment variables.

## Conclusion

The D-shirts e-commerce platform is a testament to modern web development practices, showcasing a well-thought-out architecture, a powerful tech stack, and innovative implementation details.

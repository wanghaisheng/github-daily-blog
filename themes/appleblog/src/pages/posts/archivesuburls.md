- **Use of cURL**: cURL was selected for making HTTP requests to the Wayback Machine. Its robust features, such as handling redirects and setting timeouts, made it an ideal choice for this project. The `--max-time` option was particularly important, as it allows users to specify a maximum wait time for the script, preventing long hang-ups when querying large domains.

- **Output Structure**: The decision to create a dedicated folder for each target domain, containing separate files for URLs and subdomains, was made to keep the output organized and user-friendly. This structure allows users to easily locate and analyze the extracted data.

### 3. Alternative Approaches Considered

During the planning and development phases, several alternative approaches were considered:

- **Using Python or Other High-Level Languages**: While languages like Python offer more extensive libraries and error handling capabilities, the decision was made to stick with Bash for its simplicity and the target audience's familiarity with shell scripting. The goal was to create a lightweight tool that could be executed quickly without the overhead of a more complex programming environment.

- **Web Scraping Frameworks**: Although frameworks like Scrapy or Beautiful Soup could have been used for more complex scraping tasks, they would have added unnecessary complexity for the intended functionality. The focus was on a straightforward solution that could be executed with minimal setup.

### 4. Key Insights That Shaped the Project

Several insights emerged throughout the development process that significantly influenced the project:

- **User Experience Matters**: The importance of user experience became clear early on. The tool needed to be intuitive, with clear instructions and a simple command structure. This led to the decision to include usage examples in the README, ensuring that users could quickly understand how to utilize the tool.

- **Scalability and Performance**: The realization that large domains could lead to long wait times prompted the inclusion of the `time` parameter. This feature not only enhances user control but also improves the tool's performance by preventing excessive wait times during data extraction.

- **Community Feedback**: Engaging with potential users and gathering feedback on their needs and pain points helped shape the final product. Understanding the challenges faced by users when extracting data from the Wayback Machine informed the design and functionality of the tool.

In conclusion, the development of `archivesuburls` was a journey marked by careful research, thoughtful technical decisions, and a focus on user experience. The result is a simple yet effective tool that addresses a specific need within the cybersecurity and web research communities, enabling users to efficiently extract valuable historical web data.

## Under the Hood

## Technical Deep-Dive: `archivesuburls`

### 1. Architecture Decisions

The `archivesuburls` tool is designed with a simple yet effective architecture that focuses on extracting subdomains and URLs from the Wayback Machine. The architecture is primarily linear, consisting of a single Bash script that handles all operations. This design choice allows for easy deployment and execution in a Linux environment without the need for complex dependencies or installations.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The script is focused solely on extracting data from the Wayback Machine, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Modularity**: While the tool is a single script, it can be easily extended or modified to include additional features, such as filtering or formatting the output.
- **User Input Handling**: The script accepts command-line arguments, allowing users to specify the target domain and an optional timeout, enhancing flexibility.

### 2. Key Technologies Used

- **Bash Scripting**: The entire tool is implemented in Bash, which is suitable for quick scripting tasks and is widely available in Linux environments.
- **cURL**: This command-line tool is used for making HTTP requests to the Wayback Machine. It is a powerful utility that supports various protocols and options, including timeout settings.
- **Wayback Machine API**: The script interacts with the Wayback Machine's API to retrieve archived URLs and subdomains.

### 3. Interesting Implementation Details

- **File Handling**: The script creates a dedicated folder for each target domain, ensuring that the output files (`wayback-urls.out` and `wayback-subdomains.out`) are organized and easily accessible. This is done using the `mkdir` command:
  ```bash
  mkdir target.com
  ```

- **Dynamic Timeout**: The script allows users to specify a timeout for the cURL requests. This is particularly useful for large domains where the search may take a long time. The implementation uses the `--max-time` option in cURL:
  ```bash
  curl --max-time $TIME -o wayback-urls.out "http://archive.org/wayback/..."
  ```

- **Output Formatting**: The script separates URLs and subdomains into two distinct files, making it easier for users to process the results. This is achieved through simple redirection in Bash:
  ```bash
  echo "Extracted URLs" > wayback-urls.out
  echo "Extracted Subdomains" > wayback-subdomains.out
  ```

### 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

- **Handling Large Domains**: One of the main challenges is dealing with large domains that may have extensive archived data. The implementation of a timeout feature allows users to limit the duration of the extraction process, preventing the script from hanging indefinitely.

- **Error Handling**: While the README does not explicitly mention error handling, it is crucial in a production script. Implementing checks for successful cURL requests and validating the output files would enhance the robustness of the tool. For example:
  ```bash
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Error fetching data from Wayback Machine"
      exit 1
  fi
  ```

- **Rate Limiting**: When making multiple requests to the Wayback Machine, it is essential to consider rate limiting to avoid being blocked. Implementing a delay between requests could be a potential enhancement:
  ```bash
  sleep 1  # Sleep for 1 second between requests
  ```

### Conclusion

The `archivesuburls` tool is a straightforward yet powerful Bash script that leverages cURL and the Wayback Machine API to extract valuable data. Its architecture is simple, focusing on usability and flexibility, while the implementation details highlight effective use of Bash scripting techniques. By addressing challenges such as handling large domains and potential errors, the tool provides a reliable solution for users looking to extract archived URLs and subdomains.

## 2. Key Technologies Used

Storyscape leverages a variety of technologies to deliver its features:

- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing, which helps catch errors during development and improves code quality. For example, defining interfaces for user profiles enhances type safety:

  ```typescript
  interface UserProfile {
      userId: string;
      name: string;
      bio: string;
      image: string;
  }
  ```

- **React**: The core library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable components. For instance, a profile card component can be created as follows:

  ```javascript
  const ProfileCard = ({ user }: { user: UserProfile }) => (
      <div className="profile-card">
          <img src={user.image} alt={user.name} />
          <h2>{user.name}</h2>
          <p>{user.bio}</p>
      </div>
  );
  ```

- **Next.js**: Enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), improving performance and SEO. For example, fetching user data on the server side can be done in a Next.js page:

  ```javascript
  export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
      const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${context.params.id}`);
      const user = await res.json();
      return { props: { user } };
  }
  ```

- **AppWrite**: Acts as the backend service, providing APIs for authentication, database, and storage. The integration with AppWrite allows for easy management of user data and media files.

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

- **Real-time Features**: Storyscape implements real-time updates using AppWrite's real-time capabilities. For instance, when a user likes a post, the like count is updated in real-time across all clients:

  ```javascript
  const subscribeToLikes = (postId) => {
      const unsubscribe = appwrite.database.subscribe('likes', (response) => {
          if (response.documentId === postId) {
              setLikes(response.data.likes);
          }
      });
      return unsubscribe;
  };
  ```

- **Image Processing**: The application uses `Image-js` for image processing tasks, such as cropping and resizing images before uploading them to the server. This ensures that images are optimized for performance:

  ```javascript
  const cropImage = (image, cropArea) => {
      const croppedImage = image.crop(cropArea.x, cropArea.y, cropArea.width, cropArea.height);
      return croppedImage;
  };
  ```

- **Accessibility**: Storyscape adheres to accessibility guidelines by implementing ARIA roles and ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard navigable. For example, a button component can be enhanced for accessibility:

  ```javascript
  const AccessibleButton = ({ onClick, children }) => (
      <button onClick={onClick} aria-label={children}>
          {children}
      </button>
  );
  ```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

- **Handling Real-time Data**: One of the challenges was managing real-time data updates efficiently. The team implemented a subscription model using AppWrite's real-time capabilities, which allowed for seamless updates without requiring full page reloads.

- **State Management Complexity**: As the application grew, managing state across multiple components became complex. The decision to use Zustand simplified state management, allowing for a more straightforward approach to sharing state across components without the overhead of Redux.

- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring that the application performs well on both desktop and mobile devices was a challenge. The team utilized Next.js's SSR capabilities to pre-render pages, reducing load times and improving the user experience.

- **Security and Privacy**: Implementing robust security measures to protect user data was critical.

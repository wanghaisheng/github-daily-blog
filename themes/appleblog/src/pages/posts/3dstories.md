Several interesting implementation details enhance the functionality and user experience of the 3D Stories application:

- **Animated Storyline**: The application features an animated storyline that guides users through the details of the 3D objects. This is implemented using Theatre JS, where each object can have its own animation timeline. For example:

  ```javascript
  import { useAnimation } from 'theatre-react';

  const My3DObject = () => {
      const { play, stop } = useAnimation('myAnimation');

      return (
          <mesh onClick={play}>
              <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
              <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
          </mesh>
      );
  };
  ```

- **Orbit Tool**: The orbit tool allows users to explore 3D models from different angles. This is achieved using the `OrbitControls` from Three.js, which enables rotation, zooming, and panning of the 3D scene.

  ```javascript
  import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';

  const Scene = () => {
      return (
          <>
              <ambientLight />
              <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
              <My3DObject />
              <OrbitControls />
          </>
      );
  };
  ```

- **Modal Windows**: Modal windows provide additional context and information about the 3D objects. These are implemented using React's state management to control the visibility of the modal.

  ```javascript
  const [isModalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
      <>
          <button onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>Show Details</button>
          {isModalOpen && (
              <Modal onClose={() => setModalOpen(false)}>
                  <h2>Object Details</h2>
                  <p>Additional information about the object.</p>
              </Modal>
          )}
      </>
  );
  ```

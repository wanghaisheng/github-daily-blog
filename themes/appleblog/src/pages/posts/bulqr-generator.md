## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### QR Code Generation

The core functionality of the application revolves around generating QR codes. The `QRcode` library is utilized to create QR codes based on user input. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how QR codes are generated:

```javascript
import QRCode from 'qrcode';

const generateQRCode = async (text) => {
  try {
    const qrCodeDataUrl = await QRCode.toDataURL(text);
    return qrCodeDataUrl;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating QR code:', error);
  }
};
```

### Form Handling with React Hook Form

The application uses `react-hook-form` to manage form submissions efficiently. This library minimizes re-renders and provides a simple API for form validation. Hereâ€™s an example of how to set up a form:

```javascript
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

const QRCodeForm = () => {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log(data);
    // Generate QR code logic here
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <input {...register('text')} placeholder="Enter text for QR code" />
      <button type="submit">Generate QR Code</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

### Color Customization

Using `react-colorful`, users can customize the color of their QR codes. This feature enhances user experience by allowing personalization. Hereâ€™s how color selection is integrated:

```javascript
import { ColorPicker } from 'react-colorful';

const QRCodeCustomizer = ({ onColorChange }) => {
  return (
    <ColorPicker onChange={onColorChange} />
  );
};
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Performance Optimization

One of the challenges faced was ensuring that the application remained performant while generating multiple QR codes. To address this, the QR code generation process was optimized by using asynchronous functions and memoization techniques to cache results.

### Handling Large Data Sets

When generating up to 200 QR codes, managing state and rendering performance became critical. The application employs React's `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance.

```javascript
const memoizedQRCode = useMemo(() => generateQRCode(inputText), [inputText]);
```

### File Download Management

Creating a zip file containing multiple QR codes was another challenge. The `client-zip` library was integrated to handle this functionality seamlessly. The implementation allows users to download all generated QR codes in a single action:

```javascript
import JSZip from 'client-zip';

const downloadZip = async (qrCodes) => {
  const zip = new JSZip();
  qrCodes.forEach((code, index) => {
    zip.file(`qr_code_${index + 1}.png`, code);
  });
  const content = await zip.generateAsync({ type: 'blob

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Managing Dependencies
One of the challenges in a monorepo setup is managing dependencies across multiple applications. The use of `pnpm` as a package manager helps to optimize dependency management by creating a single store for all packages, reducing duplication and improving installation speed.

### Type Safety in API Communication
Implementing type-safe API communication with tRPC required careful design of the API routes and data models. By defining the API schema in TypeScript, developers can ensure that both the client and server are in sync, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

### Edge Computing Considerations
Deploying applications on Cloudflare Workers necessitated a shift in mindset regarding serverless architecture. Developers had to consider cold starts, execution time limits, and the stateless nature of serverless functions. This required optimizing code for performance and minimizing the use of stateful operations.

### Example of tRPC Router Definition
Here’s a simplified example of how a tRPC router might be defined in the `packages/trpc` directory:

```typescript
import { createRouter } from '@trpc/server';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const appRouter = createRouter()
  .query('getUser', {
    input: z.string(),
    resolve({ input }) {
      return getUserFromDatabase(input); // Fetch user from D1 database
    },
  })
  .mutation('createUser', {
    input: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      email: z.string().email(),
    }),
    resolve({ input }) {
      return createUserInDatabase(input); // Create user in D1 database
    },
  });

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

This example illustrates how to define a simple API with a query to fetch a user and a mutation to create a new user, showcasing the type safety provided by TypeScript and zod.

let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: 'smtp.example.com',
    port: 587,
    secure: false,
    auth: {
        user: 'user@example.com',
        pass: 'password'
    }
});

let mailOptions = {
    from: '"Sender Name" <sender@example.com>',
    to: 'recipient@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello',
    text: 'Hello world?',
    html: '<b>Hello world?</b>'
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
    if (error) {
        return console.log(error);
    }
    console.log('Message sent: %s', info.messageId);
});
```

- **AnimationComponent**: Manages animations using GSAP.
- **Footer Component**: Displays additional information and links.

This modular approach allows developers to work on individual components without affecting the entire application, facilitating collaboration and code management.

## 2. Key Technologies Used

### React

React serves as the backbone of the application, enabling the creation of a dynamic user interface. The component-based architecture allows for the encapsulation of logic and presentation, making it easier to manage state and lifecycle events.

### Three.js

Three.js is utilized to create and render the 3D model of the iPhone 15 Pro. It provides a powerful API for rendering 3D graphics in the browser, allowing for realistic lighting, shadows, and textures.

Example of initializing a Three.js scene:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Add a 3D model here
```

### GSAP

GSAP is employed for creating smooth animations. It allows for complex animations to be defined in a straightforward manner, enhancing the user experience.

Example of a simple GSAP animation:

```javascript
import { gsap } from 'gsap';

gsap.to('.element', { duration: 1, x: 100, opacity: 1 });
```

### TypeScript

TypeScript is used to enforce type safety, which helps in reducing runtime errors. It allows developers to define interfaces and types, making the code more predictable and easier to understand.

Example of a TypeScript interface:

```typescript
interface ModelProps {
  modelUrl: string;
  position: [number, number, number];
}
```

### Vite

Vite is chosen as the build tool for its fast development server and efficient bundling capabilities. It provides a smooth development experience with hot module replacement (HMR), allowing developers to see changes in real-time.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling the application. Its utility-first approach allows for rapid UI development, enabling developers to apply styles directly in the markup.

Example of using Tailwind CSS for styling:

```html
<div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-gray-100">
  <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">iPhone 15 Pro</h1>
</div>
```

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### 3D Model Interaction

The ModelViewer component allows users to interact with the 3D model of the iPhone 15 Pro. Users can rotate, zoom, and pan the model using mouse or touch gestures. This is achieved by integrating Three.js with event listeners.

Example of handling mouse events:

```javascript
const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
  const mouseX = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  const mouseY = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
  
  // Update the model's rotation based on mouse position
  model.rotation.y = mouseX * Math.PI;
  model.rotation.x = mouseY * Math.PI;
};

window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
```

### Responsive Design

The use of Tailwind CSS ensures that the landing page is fully responsive. Media queries and utility classes allow for a seamless experience across different devices. For instance, the layout adjusts based on screen size, ensuring that the 3D model and text are appropriately sized.

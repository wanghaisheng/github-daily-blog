## Under the Hood

# Technical Deep-Dive: BetaBuzz

## 1. Architecture Decisions

BetaBuzz is designed as a full-stack web application that allows users to share and discover new products. The architecture follows a client-server model, where the frontend and backend are separated into distinct applications. This separation allows for scalability and easier maintenance.

### Key Architectural Choices:
- **Microservices Approach**: The application is divided into two main components: the API (backend) and the app (frontend). This separation allows for independent development and deployment.
- **RESTful API**: The backend is built using Express.js, providing a RESTful interface for the frontend to interact with. This design choice simplifies the communication between the client and server.
- **JWT Authentication**: For user authentication, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used. This stateless authentication method enhances security and scalability.
- **Cloud Storage**: User-generated content is stored in Amazon S3, allowing for scalable and reliable storage solutions.

## 2. Key Technologies Used

BetaBuzz leverages several modern technologies to build a robust application:

- **Frontend**: 
  - **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, improving performance and SEO.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with a focus on responsiveness and customization.

- **Backend**:
  - **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user data and product information, allowing for flexible data models.

- **Payment Processing**: 
  - **Stripe**: Integrated for handling subscriptions and premium features, providing a secure and reliable payment processing solution.

## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### Folder Structure
The folder structure is organized to separate concerns clearly, making it easier for developers to navigate the codebase. For example:

```sh
.
├── api
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── config
│   │   ├── controllers
│   │   ├── models
│   │   ├── routes
│   │   └── services
└── app
    ├── components
    ├── pages
    ├── services
    └── styles
```

### JWT Authentication
The implementation of JWT for authentication is straightforward. Upon user login, a token is generated and sent back to the client. The client stores this token and includes it in the headers of subsequent requests:

```javascript
// Example of generating a JWT token
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function generateToken(user) {
    return jwt.sign({ id: user._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
}
```

### Recursive Comments
The comments system allows for nested comments, similar to Reddit. This is achieved by storing comments in a hierarchical structure in the database:

```javascript
const commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    content: String,
    userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
    parentId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Comment', default: null },
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### Handling User-Generated Content
One of the challenges was managing user-generated content effectively. By utilizing Amazon S3 for storage, the application can handle large amounts of data without impacting performance. The integration is straightforward:

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

function uploadFile(file) {
    const params = {
        Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET,
        Key: file.name,
        Body: file.data,
    };
    return s3.upload(params).promise();
}
```

### Subscription Management
Integrating Stripe for subscription management posed challenges, particularly in handling webhooks for payment events. The application listens for events from Stripe to update user subscriptions accordingly:

```javascript
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

app.post('/webhook', express.json(), (req, res) => {
    const event = req.body;

    switch (event.type) {
        case 'customer.subscription.updated':
            // Handle subscription update
            break;
        // Handle other event types
    }

    res.json({ received: true });
});
```

### Scalability
As the user base grows, ensuring the application remains performant is crucial. By using a microservices architecture and cloud services, BetaBuzz can scale horizontally, adding more instances of the API and frontend as needed.

## Conclusion

BetaBuzz is a modern web application that effectively combines various technologies to create a platform for discovering and sharing beta products. The architectural decisions, choice of technologies, and implementation details reflect a focus on scalability, performance, and user experience. The

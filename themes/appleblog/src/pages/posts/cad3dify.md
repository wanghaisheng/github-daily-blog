import requests
from PIL import Image

def process_image(image_path):
    # Load and preprocess the image
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    # Perform necessary preprocessing steps
    return image

def generate_3d_model(image, model_type, api_key):
    # Prepare the API request
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    data = {
        'model': model_type,
        'input_image': image
    }
    response = requests.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/models/generate', headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()
```

In this example, the `process_image` function handles the loading and preprocessing of the input image, while the `generate_3d_model` function prepares and sends the request to the OpenAI API, demonstrating the integration of image processing and AI model invocation.

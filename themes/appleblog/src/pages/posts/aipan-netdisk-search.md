## 3. Interesting Implementation Details

### Resource Management
The resource management feature is implemented using a combination of Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL. The database schema is designed to handle various resource types, including files, links, and metadata. For example, the following Prisma model defines a resource:

```prisma
model Resource {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  type      String
  url       String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### Batch Import/Export
The batch import/export functionality allows users to manage large datasets efficiently. The application supports CSV and XLSX formats for importing resources. The following code snippet demonstrates how to handle CSV file uploads:

```javascript
const csv = require('csv-parser');
const fs = require('fs');

fs.createReadStream('path/to/file.csv')
  .pipe(csv())
  .on('data', (row) => {
    // Process each row and save to the database
    saveResource(row);
  })
  .on('end', () => {
    console.log('CSV file successfully processed');
  });
```

### Admin Dashboard
The admin dashboard is built using Vue components and provides a user-friendly interface for managing resources. It includes features like user management, resource tracking, and analytics. The following Vue component demonstrates a simple resource listing:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Resource List</h1>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="resource in resources" :key="resource.id">
        {{ resource.name }} - {{ resource.type }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      resources: []
    };
  },
  mounted() {
    this.fetchResources();
  },
  methods: {
    async fetchResources() {
      const response = await fetch('/api/resources');
      this.resources = await response.json();
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

## 4. Technical Challenges Overcome

### API Rate Limiting
One of the significant challenges faced during development was dealing with third-party API rate limits. To mitigate this, the application implements caching strategies using Redis to store frequently accessed data, reducing the number of API calls made.

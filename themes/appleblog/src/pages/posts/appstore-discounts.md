### Unlocking Savings: My Journey to Creating an App Store Discounts Tracker

Have you ever scrolled through the App Store, eyeing that must-have app, only to hesitate at the price? I know I have. The frustration of missing out on discounts or deals can be disheartening, especially when you’re trying to stay within budget. This sparked an idea in my mind: what if there was a way to track these discounts effortlessly? That’s how my journey began, leading to the creation of an open-source App Store discounts tracker built on GitHub Actions.

As a tech enthusiast and a budget-conscious app lover, I was motivated to develop a solution that would not only help me but also others who share the same struggle. I envisioned a tool that would send notifications directly to my phone, alerting me whenever my favorite apps went on sale. However, the road to bringing this idea to life was not without its challenges. Navigating the complexities of GitHub Actions and ensuring seamless integration with notification platforms like RSS, Telegram, and DingTalk was no small feat. 

But with determination and a passion for coding, I persevered. I’m excited to share a quick overview of the solution I crafted: a user-friendly tracker that keeps you updated on the latest discounts, ensuring you never miss a deal again. Join me as I delve deeper into the features of this project, the lessons I learned along the way, and how you can benefit from it too!

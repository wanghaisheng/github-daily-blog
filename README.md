I have been Githuber since 2011 and create 4k repos and stars more than 5k.

since last year I decide to make 100 mini project before 40, so I came back and adjust a bit that I should turn idea to product ,not just half down code ,either working or not , without anyone know what I am doing.


So I came to this idea to build a blog like newsletter for myself, if someone interested, sub the rss link
